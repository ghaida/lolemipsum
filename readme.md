# LOLem Ipsum

This is the coolest twitter bot in all the land! It'll generate a short paragraph of lorem ipsum text for you. You can get these flavors of lorem ipsum:

* Cats :cat: text from: http://catipsum.com
* Meats :meat_on_bone: text from http://baconipsum.com
* Hipster :eyeglasses: text from http://hipsum.co/
* Space :stars: text from http://spaceipsum.com/
* Yoga :ok_woman: text from http://www.kellykundalini.com/yoga/funny-yoga-filler-text-aka-yoga-ipsum/

Obvi there are probably better ways to get the text than to just put static text in array but whatevs.

I followed this awesome tutorial by Imogen Wentworth to create the bot:

To use this awesome bot, tweet "gimme [cat, bacon, hipster, space, yoga] text" @lolem_ipsum.
