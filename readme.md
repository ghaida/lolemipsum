# LOLem Ipsum

This is the coolest twitter bot in all the land! It'll generate a short paragraph of lorem ipsum text for you. You can get these flavors of lorem ipsum:

* :cat: Cats text from: http://catipsum.com
* :meat_on_bone: Meats text from http://baconipsum.com
* :eyeglasses: Hipster text from http://hipsum.co/
* :stars: Space text from http://spaceipsum.com/
* :ok_woman: Yoga text from http://www.kellykundalini.com/yoga/funny-yoga-filler-text-aka-yoga-ipsum/
* :muscle: Climbing text
* :taco_emoji: Taco Bell
* :dog2: Doge text from http://dogeipsum.com/
* :fallen_leaf: Hylian

Obvi there are probably better ways to get the text than to just put static text in array but whatevs.

I followed this awesome tutorial by Imogen Wentworth to create the bot:

To use this awesome bot, tweet "[cat, bacon, hipster, space, yoga, swol, taco bell, doge, zelda]" @lolem_ipsum.
