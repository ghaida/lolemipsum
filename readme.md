# LOLem Ipsum

This is the coolest twitter bot in all the land! It'll generate a short paragraph of lorem ipsum text for you. You can get these flavors of lorem ipsum:

* Cats :cat:
* Bacon :meat_on_bone:

Obvi there are probably better ways to get the text than to just put static text in array but whatevs.

I followed this awesome tutorial by Imogen Wentworth to create the bot:

To use this awesome bot, tweet "gimme [cat, bacon] text" @lolem_ipsum.
